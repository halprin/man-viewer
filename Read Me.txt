Man Viewer
http://www.kendallp.net/at_PAK/

Thanks for downloading Man Viewer!  It allows you to easily view UNIX manual pages.

A few things you can do is search based on the name, filter based on the section, and save the man page in plain text and in Styled PostScript.  The Styled PostScript can be converted to a PDF by opening the saved file in Preview.app.  Two other features include hovering over a man page entry in the list which shows the path to the man page as a tooltip, and right/control clicking on a man page entry allowing you to reveal that man page in the Finder by the context menu.

By default on first launch, the preferences are set to the output of /usr/bin/manpath.  You can view the preferences by pressing (⌘ + ,).  Here you can customize the directories that Man Viewer searches for man pages.  Just type a new path in the text box and then press the + button to add a directory.  Select a directory in the list and press the - buton to delete it.  Double click on a directory in the list to edit it.  You can also press the "Reload from manpath" button to set your preferences back to the output of /usr/bin/manpath.

There is a caching feature that caches the entries found so subsequent launches are much faster.  If you rather force Man Viewer to scan the disk again for the man pages at launch, hold down ⌘ while launching the application.  While the application is running you can go to File -> Update (⌘U) to force Man Viewer to scan the disk again for the man pages.  The caching feature is disabled if this is the first time that a new version of Man Viewer is ran.

Change log:

Version 3.1.3
* Fixed:  The window size and split view remembers its position between subsequent launches for real in this version
* Tooltips show the path to the man page upon hovering over the entry in the list
* Upon right/control clicking on a man page in the list, a context menu pops up allowing the user to reveal the man page in the Finder

Version 3.1.2
* Fixed a bug that made Man Viewer incorrectly state that "That man page does not exist!" when, in reality, it definitely existed
* The window close button is now activated and will quit the application if pressed
* You can now have Man Viewer launch and auto select a man page by passing the name (and optionally the section) as a command line argument
* If you load MacPorts' man pages, you should no longer see (turd_MacPorts) in the list

Version 3.1.1
* Changed the $MANPATH feature to use /usr/bin/manpath instead (this is for Snow Leopard users or those who have an empty $MANPATH environment variable)
* Fixed the manpath feature so that it uses your default login shell instead of just bash (this is for those who don't use bash as your login shell)
* Upon clicking on a different man page, the viewer scrolls to the top so you see the beginning whether or not you were scrolled down in the previous man page
* Fixed some minor bugs in the preferences pane

Version 3.1
* Refactored some code so that initial launch times are extremely fast compared to previous versions!
* Added a caching feature so after the initial launch, future launches will yet be even faster
* On first run the preferences default to what $MANPATH is set to.  Also there is now a button in the preferences that allows you to revert the preferences to $MANPATH
* When searching for man pages on disk, Man Viewer now also scans manl sub-folders

Version 3.0.1
* Fixed a bug that made the program crash when trying to view a large man page

Version 3.0:
* Programmed in Cocoa, therefore Man Viewer is a Universal Binary, faster, smaller, and better!
* Preferences have been improved
* Faster searching
* Support for Mac OS X 10.5 with no .gz duplicates
