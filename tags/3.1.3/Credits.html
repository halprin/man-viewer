Version 3.1.3<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed:  The window size and split view remembers its position between subsequent launches for real</li>
<li>Tooltips show the path to the man page upon hovering over the entry in the list</li>
<li>Upon right/control clicking on a man page in the list, a context menu pops up allowing the user to reveal the man page in the Finder</li>
</ul>
<br>
Version 3.1.2<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that made Man Viewer incorrectly state that "That man page does not exist!" when, in reality, it definitely existed</li>
<li>The window close button is now activated and will quit the application if pressed</li>
<li>You can now have Man Viewer launch and auto select a man page by passing the name (and optionally the section) as a command line argument</li>
<li>If you load MacPorts' man pages, you should no longer see (turd_MacPorts) in the list</li>
</ul>
<br>
Version 3.1.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Changed the $MANPATH feature to use /usr/bin/manpath instead (this is for Snow Leopard users or those who have an empty $MANPATH environment variable)</li>
<li>Fixed the manpath feature so that it uses your default login shell instead of just bash (this is for those who don't use bash as your login shell)</li>
<li>Upon clicking on a different man page, the viewer scrolls to the top so you see the beginning whether or not you were scrolled down in the previous man page</li>
<li>Fixed some minor bugs in the preferences pane</li>
</ul>
<br>
Version 3.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Refactored some code so that initial launch times are extremely fast compared to previous versions!</li>
<li>Added a caching feature so after the initial launch, future launches will yet be even faster</li>
<li>On first run the preferences default to what $MANPATH is set to.  Also there is now a button in the preferences that allows you to revert the preferences to $MANPATH</li>
<li>When searching for man pages on disk, Man Viewer now also scans manl sub-folders</li>
</ul>
<br>
Version 3.0.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that made the program crash when trying to view a large man page</li>
</ul>
<br>
Version 3.0<br>
<ul>
<li>Programmed in Cocoa, therefore Man Viewer is a Universal Binary, faster, smaller, and better!</li>
<li>Preferences have been improved</li>
<li>Faster searching</li>
<li>Support for Mac OS X 10.5 with no .gz duplicates</li>
</ul>
